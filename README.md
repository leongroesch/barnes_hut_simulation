+ Field size: The high and with of the displayed area in meter
+ Number of bodys: The number of bodys to generate
+ Minimum mass: The minimum mass a body can have in kg
+ Maximum mass: The maximum mass a body can have in kg  
The Masses of the bodys are equally distributed between the maximum and the minimum mass
